        Use Large Image and Language models to create a comic generator app. Fine tune the models on your favorite styles and make a fun app you can share with your friends. 
<br>
We can also explore creating videos out of the comics we generate (basically text to animeðŸ˜‹) if time permits. 
<br>
We'll be making use of cutting edge diffusion models for image and video generation (think stable diffusion, modelscope, etc) and large language models like GPT3.5 and LLAMA to generate the storyline. 
<br>
If you think you'll just be stringing together APIs, you're mistaken. We will go into the depths of transformers and diffusers from whitepapers to their implementations so that you don't feel like you're juggling black boxes. 
<br>
Here's a basic version of the app you're going to make - https://sparkler.club/
Needless to say, we'll be adding many more features.
