     The scientific world is in shock after the murder of a famous scientist in the streets of Mumbai. Detective Jane has been called to investigate this high profile murder case. Looking at the tampered evidence and remnants of recordings, detective Jane thinks only the students of IIT Bombay can solve this mystery using computer vision techniques. Jane and her team are working hard on collecting evidence which the plan to release every week by collecting surveillance videos or other sources of videos, investigating hotels and nearby shops etc. We, the mentors of the project have been assigned the task to build a team which we‚Äôve decided to call, ‚ÄúThe Watchdogs‚Äù. We need very enthusiastic and passionate mentees to bring the scientific world to justice.

Prerequisites:
Python, maybe some prev computer vision knowledge and a lot of enthusiasm üí™
