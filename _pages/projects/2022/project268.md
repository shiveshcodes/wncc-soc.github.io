1 NFTs have gained a lot of popularity in recent years. We will develop an NFT
a marketplace that allows users to buy, sell, and trade unique digital assets like art, music,
and collectibles. 
<br>
2 By learning about blockchain development, you will have the opportunity to create smart contracts for our website and app, and as a result, gain exposure to web and app development as a complementary skill set.
<br>
3 The resources for the learning are as follows:- 
    (i) https://anders.com/blockchain/
    (ii) https://www.udemy.com/course/solidity-smart-contract-development/
    (iii) https://www.codewithharry.com/videos/react-tutorials-in-hindi-1/
    (iv) Full Stack Ethereum Dapp Tutorial: https://www.dappuniversity.com/articles/full-stack-ethereum-dapp-tutorial-part-1
    (v) Blockchain Developer Roadmap: https://github.com/web3coach/Blockchain-Developer-Roadmap
<br>
Prerequisites:
As a mentor, here are some pre-requisites that I would expect from the mentees:

1 Basic Programming Skills: It is helpful if my mentees have a basic understanding of programming concepts, such as variables, data types, control structures, and functions.

2 Familiarity with JavaScript: JavaScript is a popular programming language that is commonly used in blockchain development, so having some experience with JavaScript would be beneficial.

3 Understanding of Web Development: Since blockchain applications often require a front-end interface, my mentees should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and web development concepts.

4  Knowledge of Blockchain Basics: My mentees should have a basic understanding of blockchain technology and how it works, including the concepts of distributed ledgers, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts. Just the roadmap OfCourse

Don't worry if you don't know some of these, I and my co-mentor will make you learn all of these and help you at all the points        <br>
